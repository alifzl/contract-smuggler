# Contract Smuggler

Words can't express how saddened I am to writing this.<br>
But surely exposing this vulnaribility misght be like a pat on the soulders of [bussiness in a box](https://www.business-in-a-box.com/) guys,<br> in order to make the things more hardened :))

## How to steal?

1. prepare a list (like mine 'list.xlsx') containing the IDs of your beloved contracts in your root directory.
2. resolve the dependencies.
3. download the chrome verison 81 driver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).  
4. clean the mess in the jupyter notebook and there you go.

## Oh, snap! Really?

This is just a POC code in order to show [these](https://www.business-in-a-box.com/) guys to be more carefull in letting curious usres access their property.<br> I would be so happy if you don't use this script for your vicious purposes. :D
